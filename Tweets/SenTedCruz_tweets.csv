1085695277053427712,2019-01-17 00:28:19,"Now these companies will reenter the market, driving down costs and increasing the competitiveness of U.S. firms, including firms that employ tens of thousands of Texans."
1085695275405111297,2019-01-17 00:28:19,"As Senate Democrats know well, this agreement weakens Deripaska--a very bad actor--which is why our European allies, including Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, and the UK, support the Treasury's decision."
1085695273496657920,2019-01-17 00:28:19,"They forced the companies to agree to a deal that permanently takes away Deripaska’s controls, denies personal profits, and implements meaningful checks to prevent backsliding or cheating in exchange for lifting sanctions."
1085695271810535424,2019-01-17 00:28:18,The Treasury Department told those companies that those sanctions would not be lifted until Deripaska gave up his control.
1085695270032007168,2019-01-17 00:28:18,"Last year the Trump administration correctly targeted a sanctioned Kremlin-linked oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, and sanctioned three Russian companies he controlled, including aluminum companies."
1085695268362817537,2019-01-17 00:28:17,"Much work remains to be done to clarify and apply these standards, including in Iran where sanctioned entities like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps control entire sectors of the economy, and I support implementing legislation as aggressively as possible."
1085695266894815232,2019-01-17 00:28:17,One of the most important elements of this sanctions legislation is that it directly targets oligarchs and terrorists who control companies in important industries.
1085695265510707201,2019-01-17 00:28:17,"I joined my colleagues in 2017 in voting for the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act to turn the tide in pushing back against Russian hostility &amp; have urged the admin to broadly sanction Iranian, Russian &amp; North Korean bad actors pursuant to that legislation."
1085695263967199232,2019-01-17 00:28:16,"Russia’s hostile actions include bolstering Iran and Assad in Syria, illegally annexing Crimea, and launching waves of cyberattacks against us and our allies. The Obama administration refused to hold Putin accountable."
1085695262209785862,2019-01-17 00:28:16,"And, for eight years, President Obama--with the active support of Senate Democrats--demonstrated weakness and appeasement towards Russia, which only encouraged Russian aggression."
1085695259286388739,2019-01-17 00:28:15,"Senate Democrats have already shut down the government to prevent commonsense border security, and just this week they have filibustered legislation to strengthen Israel and weaken America's enemies."
