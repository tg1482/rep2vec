But Im more concerned about what could happen if the Biden approach is approved. Why do you think the proposed BIden plan is good for Dallas or the country ? My mind is wide open to being changed"
1278387324217290752,2020-07-01 17:57:44,"@onesedonia No. I said the current Dem program does not address the unique economic problems we now have. That they need to be far stronger and bottom up. Their current plan would make things worse. And as i said, if they fix this i will change who i vote for down ballot."
1278386922042220544,2020-07-01 17:56:08,@Springisnow @TheView @BarackObama @JoeBiden I need to see a bottom up approach to fixing the economy. What is proposed on the biden website is not. It doesnt reflect the unique situation we are in. It could make things much worse for those who are suffering right now. Im against trickle down. I want real trickle up reform
1278386296449191936,2020-07-01 17:53:38,@TomDelRegno let me remind you that this is far different than 2008 and any democratic plan for the economy needs to reflect the uniqueness of the economic situation we are in. Otherwise it could fail miserably

With the proposed plan the shit would flow down hill worse than it is now. I'm not a cornyn fan at all, but I don't want a plan that crushes minority communities"
1278379495209091072,2020-07-01 17:26:37,"@willbchill The same concept applies to hospitals. Both are trying to solve social problems.  Hospitals call them social determinants of health. Combine the SDOH budgets from hospitals and PDs and related  community programs, then we can focus on providing help to the core issues."

1193421415741034497,2019-11-10 06:53:32,@eshap But wait there‚Äôs more. Your NyC friends making more &gt;515k will have to pay regular income tax rates on earned and increases in unearned capital gains. That‚Äôs in addition to the %14.8 NIIT and regular income taxes and NY state and local taxes. Think people move from NY/Cali ?
1193418728370778112,2019-11-10 06:42:52,@eshap Her wealth tax is above her net worth. Her increased Net Investment Income Tax of 14.8% won‚Äôt touch her either. But it could DESTROY those living off of investment income in high tax high cost of living cities. https://t.co/jEkyyA26os
1193415396285661184,2019-11-10 06:29:37,@kfury How does feature creep work when you design software ? What happens to the end product when someone tells you we need everything ?
1193415159332651014,2019-11-10 06:28:41,@kfury She filed jointly. She paid taxes jointly she has joint asset accounts and real estate. It‚Äôs not possible to segregate the two for tax calculations
1193414837939965954,2019-11-10 06:27:24,@kfury I‚Äôm not comparing candidates. ANY healthcare program built exclusively on private insurance will fail. The greatest healthcare lie ever told is that insurance is a proxy for wellness. The only system that will work is hybrid between single payer and public/private care.
1193413608941719552,2019-11-10 06:22:31,@kfury awkward doesn‚Äôt make it wrong.  I asked one of her economists about some assumptions they used for her model. I‚Äôm still waiting.  Has anyone asked her what happens to employment and wages when so much capital is redirected so quickly? I have no clue and either does she.
1193411162555273222,2019-11-10 06:12:48,@eshap How do you figure she is treating herself more harshly than anyone else ?
1193410705162145794,2019-11-10 06:10:59,@AndyCobb Healthcare is without question a human right. You should probably ask for a plan that improves wellness and invests in helping people get and stay healthy rather than one only trying to pay when people are sick. One that doesn‚Äôt rely on Hail Mary legislation that has no shot

1193401663060676608,2019-11-10 05:35:03,@BriannaWu @ewarren bernies approach is in my opinion far more honest than her‚Äôs.  Bernie basically has said we will tax as much as we can and figure how to allocate the money to pay from there. She knows she is misleading people saying her plan could work
1193400334443597824,2019-11-10 05:29:46,@kfury No it does not. Nor does it disqualify anyone else from questioning her approach or motives.

1193285800156377089,2019-11-09 21:54:39,@nekko377 @ewarren Look at her FEC filing and see which apply and which don't .
1193283867920289792,2019-11-09 21:46:58,But it's a service that is needed. The paper pusher is still at their gov job but I believe  AI will usher in government as a service which will allow government to be far more efficient and impactful. But we aren't hearing about efficient and/or effectiveness from any candidate
1193283866036973568,2019-11-09 21:46:58,You know what crushes an economy? Social unrest. Food and housing insecurities  and people who cant pay for the care they need in order to work and contribute.

1193279905452175361,2019-11-09 21:31:14,@MudcatOakCliff It's a hybrid. Under 400% of the poverty level healthcare is free.  From there you pay premiums as a percent of income . As your income grows the percent grows from 2 up to 10% .  Key is that you don't pay any premiums until you use the healthcare system. Updating the model now

1193278477325209601,2019-11-09 21:25:33,@anthonyj1977 @ewarren Not when the foundation for the proposal requires things that are legislatively impossible. Look at Bernie and his $15 min wage. He branded it a living wage and he got businesses to respond. That was a big goal that is resonating because it doesn't require new fed laws

She could modify to a hybrid plan that allowed single payer for those up to 400pct of the FPL and pay for it , realistically. But that doesn‚Äôt buy votes"
1193241558512021505,2019-11-09 18:58:51,I'm fine with paying more taxes. I've said it for years  on https://t.co/9dvH6y5z4R  But the Senator is like every other candidate. She is selling shiny objects to divert attention from reality. Haven't we had enough of that  from @realDonaldTrump ?
1193241557685673985,2019-11-09 18:58:51,"She also knows there is a lack of equity in her plan as well . This is a great article  on one of its inequities , https://t.co/sICUFKARTu"
1193241557035606017,2019-11-09 18:58:51,Let's be real. @ewarren probably is the smartest of all the candidates. Intellectually she knows she is misleading the public . That the chances of getting all the necessary line items she needs for M4All  approved within 4 years are nearly impossible
1193241556188377088,2019-11-09 18:58:51,To provide a frame of reference here is a timeline for The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) https://t.co/gp56LU5ReW. And this is a far more contentious political environment than back then.
1193241554065993728,2019-11-09 18:58:50,And good for her for wanting to provide care for all . But she has several fundamental issues in her plans.  First she needs quite a few things to pass Congress in order for any of it to work. Is it realistic to think any of it will pass let alone all of it ? https://t.co/vH24bPgE9q
1193241540136767489,2019-11-09 18:58:47,"Here is the link to see where she is 
https://t.co/PTPADv8cCU"
1193241538987536384,2019-11-09 18:58:46,Forbes says her networth is north of $12m . That's being rich. Filthy rich. I'm sure it's richer than she ever imagined she would be. Good for her. She earned it. It puts her millions above the threshold for being part of the richest 1 percent by networth in our country
1193241537888555009,2019-11-09 18:58:46,According to her filings she made 900k last year which means her family earns more than  2x the amount needed to be a 1 percenter. She paid 25.5% of that in taxes which is less than the % I paid in taxes (29.85%)
1193241536932261889,2019-11-09 18:58:46,The reality for @ewarren is that this is as much to divert attention from her income and net worth as anything else.  Other than steyer she is the wealthiest of all the Dem Candidates. By far. https://t.co/IuW5pVo6Sd
