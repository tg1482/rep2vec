1020059042419535879,2018-07-19 21:33:22,What we already know about Kavanaugh is deeply troubling—which is why it’s even more critical that his full record come to light &amp; be debated in the Senate.
1020059040968249344,2018-07-19 21:33:21,President Trump is currently a subject of the special counsel investigation into Russia’s attack on our democracy—yet we’ve already uncovered that Kavanaugh is the only one from Trump’s #SCOTUS nominee list who’s openly stated that a president can't be under investigation.

1016496376262381569,2018-07-10 01:36:36,There are many reasons why this #SCOTUS nominee shouldn't move forward—now we need to fight &amp; make our voices heard. Call Republican senators &amp; demand they reject this nomination: 202-224-3121. Remember: “The power of the people is always greater than the people in power.”
1016496375041847297,2018-07-10 01:36:36,"We’re also in an critical election year &amp; according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s own rule that Supreme Court nominations should only proceed after elections, the Senate should wait to debate any nominee until after the American people have spoken in November."
1016496374186160129,2018-07-10 01:36:35,Kavanaugh has written extensively on his beliefs that a sitting president shouldn't be subject to criminal investigations or civil lawsuits—this all but assures he would work to shield Trump from any litigation or criminal proceeding related to the special counsel's investigation
1016496373229858818,2018-07-10 01:36:35,The Supreme Court could eventually end up issuing a decision on whether a sitting president can pardon himself or be criminally indicted—President Trump should not be able to nominate a justice to that court while his own investigation is ongoing.

1016496366950998017,2018-07-10 01:36:34,"Kavanaugh has a demonstrated hostility toward provisions of the Affordable Care Act—protections for those with pre-existing conditions, minimum standards for insurance, coverage for routine care like birth control &amp; breast cancer screenings are all on the line."
1016496366045007872,2018-07-10 01:36:33,President Trump has been crystal clear about his intent to only nominate justices that support overturning #RoevWade—there’s no question Kavanaugh meets this litmus test.
1016496365139054592,2018-07-10 01:36:33,We need to get money out of politics &amp; end the corrosive effect that dark money &amp; corporate donations continue to have on our democracy—but Kavanaugh's record suggests he will side with corporations and uphold our existing broken campaign finance laws.
1016496363822084097,2018-07-10 01:36:33,"If Kavanaugh is confirmed, we could see progress rolled back on many issues including the right of women to make their own medical decisions, voting rights, rights of workers to organize for better wages &amp; working conditions, the principle of equal justice under the law &amp; more."
1016496362467332096,2018-07-10 01:36:33,"Our next justice should be a champion for protecting &amp; advancing rights, not rolling them back—but Kavanaugh has a long history of demonstrating hostility toward defending the rights of everyday Americans."
