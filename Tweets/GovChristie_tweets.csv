1109946719192711171,2019-03-24 22:34:54,@orlandosgm I have consistently defended Bob Mueller from the moment he was appointed. Learn the facts
1109946117469417472,2019-03-24 22:32:30,"We are all presumed innocent under our constitution whether you are President or any other citizen. Prosecutors don’t exonerate folks because that’s not their job—they either prosecute or they don’t. When they don’t, no other exoneration is needed-we are innocent under our laws."
1109945019685916673,2019-03-24 22:28:09,Attorney General Barr &amp; Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein “have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction of justice offense.” An important finding from DOJ today.
1109943931033341953,2019-03-24 22:23:49,"On the charge of obstruction of justice, Bob Mueller’s report “does not conclude that the President committed a crime”. That’s an important finding because that is what prosecutors do—they prosecute, they do not exonerate. Why? Because we all enjoy the presumption of innocence."
1109942916439511041,2019-03-24 22:19:47,Bob Mueller “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.” Complete exoneration by one of the prosecutors with the most integrity and experience in America.

985548704181620736,2018-04-15 16:01:36,We're not supposed to care about politics as prosecutors. But what we find out from his interview is that he did. That Jim Comey did care about politics.
