1014906202537496576,2018-07-05 16:17:49,South Bend's (and America's) drop in violence compared to the 1990s didn't just happen on its own. It took sustained community action. Reversing the current trend toward younger victims will require the same. We must study what works and build on it. And everyone has a role.
1014906201447034880,2018-07-05 16:17:49,"If you are equally heartbroken by reports of gun violence, ask how you can be part of the solution. Mentor. Volunteer. Participate. Visit. Learn. Help."
1014906200373321729,2018-07-05 16:17:48,"But more than any one policy or program, we need community and cultural answers. All of us can help to break the cycles of isolation of the most at-risk (half a percent or so) young people who account for nearly all gun violence."
1014906199014289409,2018-07-05 16:17:48,"Even in a state that restricts us from locally enacting popular, constitutional, and evidence-based policies related to access to guns, we can (and do) act at the local level, from civilian street outreach to enforcement actions against violent groups."
1014906197944754176,2018-07-05 16:17:48,"We have worked to address violence through every known means, from law enforcement coordination to mentorship and employment support. Yet amid the routine statistical ups and downs, there is more and more heartbreak involving teenagers."
1014906196887777280,2018-07-05 16:17:48,"All gun violence is infuriating, but there is a deeper anguish when it involves young people. Our entire community has a role to play in breaking cycles of violence for those most at risk."
