1052295287522435073,2018-10-16 20:28:41,Reason #21 why you should vote: your vote matters.
1052295163266117632,2018-10-16 20:28:12,Reason #20 why you should vote: workers shouldn’t have to choose between earning a paycheck and spending time with their newborn or taking care of a sick family member. It’s time for paid family and sick leave policies.
1052294712688857088,2018-10-16 20:26:24,Reason #19 why you should vote: so immigrants aren’t forced into the shadows. We are a stronger nation because of our diversity.
1052294576164212736,2018-10-16 20:25:52,Reason #18 why you should vote: to elect a Congress that will pass legislation to protect Dreamers. They are Americans in every way except on paper. It’s time we honor our promise to them and give them a permanent solution so they can live up to their full potential.
1052294353601871872,2018-10-16 20:24:59,Reason #17 why you should vote: so violence against women and children is taken more seriously everywhere — from the courts to Congress.

1052293290794606593,2018-10-16 20:20:45,Reason #13 why you should vote: campaign finance reform. Special interests and large corporations have spent millions to buy elections. It’s time to get big money out of politics.

1052292667734941696,2018-10-16 20:18:17,Reason #11 why you should vote: to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. Every American deserves the ability to retire with dignity.
1052292369096302598,2018-10-16 20:17:06,Reason #10 why you should vote: so our nation’s daughters grow up knowing their work is worth just as much as our sons. We need to make equal pay for equal work a reality.
1052292146101972992,2018-10-16 20:16:12,Reason #9 why you should vote: for criminal justice reform. One of the first steps to reforming our broken criminal justice system is by replacing our bail system.
1052291928446918658,2018-10-16 20:15:21,Reason #8 why you should vote: to keep families together.
1052291707688157186,2018-10-16 20:14:28,Reason #7 why you should vote: to ensure that everyone has the ability to breathe clean air and live in a safe and healthy environment.
1052291533590925313,2018-10-16 20:13:46,Reason #6 why you should vote: to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. Too many lives have been ruined because of our regressive policies.
