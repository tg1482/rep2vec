1140311664161673216,2019-06-16 17:34:21,@paulkrugman As for my chances of contending for the White House - the money has me at #6 and rising fast. You may want to wait until our democracy speaks before you rate my - or any - candidate’s chances.
1140310882284724224,2019-06-16 17:31:14,@paulkrugman Media figures like you should do more than cite a stat - come with me to Michigan or Ohio or Western PA and explain to the workers how their jobs haven’t been automated away because your chart says otherwise.
1140310538137874438,2019-06-16 17:29:52,@paulkrugman When I spoke to 70 major CEOs and asked how many were looking to replace backoffice workers with AI - 70 hands went up. There’s a reason that technologists know this is real and about to accelerate.
1140310035811229697,2019-06-16 17:27:53,@paulkrugman The low productivity stats can be partially explained by the fact that everyone has to try to find a job in order to make ends meet. Many are doing low productivity jobs to survive. These stats are also backwards looking and ignore all that is on the horizon.
1140309263174307840,2019-06-16 17:24:48,@paulkrugman Of the 4 million manufacturing jobs lost to automation since 2000 almost half left the workforce and almost half of these workers filed for disability. We then saw surges in suicides and drug overdoses to the point where life expert has declined for 3 years.
1140308666320658434,2019-06-16 17:22:26,@paulkrugman Thanks Paul.  As you know there is plenty of evidence to support the automaton thesis. Labor force participation is stubbornly low at 63% the same level as Ecuador and Costa Rica with almost 1 out of 5 prime working age men out of the workforce.

1136701280875757568,2019-06-06 18:27:58,The best balance would be term limits that are quite long - say 18 years - that would be long enough for expertise and coalitions to be built up without letting legislators become totally careerist and self-dealing.
1136700653630214144,2019-06-06 18:25:29,The drawback to term limits is that they would entrench the non-legislative bureaucracy and may make it harder for legislators to organize as everyone keeps showing up new with a learning curve and a need to form relationships and coalitions.

1129066993800351745,2019-05-16 16:52:03,We are fighting the illusion of power.  We can win.
1129061567688003584,2019-05-16 16:30:29,Instead of pardoning billionaires I’d pardon non-violent marijuana and opiate offenders.
1129060545636765696,2019-05-16 16:26:25,Any members of the press - you might want to be there.  It will be newsworthy.  Tell your editors.  😀👍

1129048183710126080,2019-05-16 15:37:18,We are trying to double our Q1 fundraising in Q2 - $3.5 million.  It’s a big goal but we can do it!  Let’s go #YangGang!  We can with this whole thing!  https://t.co/9MVUlPZMmD
1129036918220611586,2019-05-16 14:52:32,I will say that this is about the only thing that might get rich parents to move to poor neighborhoods.
1129034490142220289,2019-05-16 14:42:53,We invented the SAT during World War II to identify smart kids to keep away from the frontlines.  Now every year is wartime.
1129034049929076736,2019-05-16 14:41:08,I should know.  I was quite good at them.
1129033869171281920,2019-05-16 14:40:25,Standardized tests are a very poor measurement of human worth and potential no matter how much you adjust them. https://t.co/jFKFpS1PJY
1129014070982713344,2019-05-16 13:21:45,"If a $20 trillion economy becomes imbalanced and punitive - as ours has - the measures to correct for it should be commensurately large.  Tweaks won’t do, especially if the winner-take-all dynamics are only accelerating."
1129013099506425856,2019-05-16 13:17:53,Most of that money would add to economic activity and growth in our communities and neighborhoods.  It doesn’t disappear.  Quite the opposite.  It would bolster a trickle-up economy from our families and people up.  It would make our economy much more dynamic and mobile.
1129012432238780416,2019-05-16 13:15:14,"It’s our money anyway.  We are all citizens and shareholders of the richest society in the history of the world.  We all contribute to our historic growth and success - and in an economy of $20 trillion we can easily afford a dividend of $1,000 a month."
1129011491708035072,2019-05-16 13:11:30,"One thing that drives me nuts is when politicians or academics complain about historic and worsening income inequality and then suggest solutions that wouldn’t even move the needle.  It’s obvious what would move the needle.  Giving people $1,000 a month.  Let’s do that."
1129008967794024448,2019-05-16 13:01:28,Now we have to debate it in the most important arena of all - the American public.  If enough of us get together we can make it real.  Change can happen faster than most believe possible.
1129008356335771648,2019-05-16 12:59:02,Universal Basic Income is becoming more and more mainstream - it has gone from marginal idea to a proposal debated in major publications and institutions.  The truth is it is inevitable - and the sooner we make it happen the better off we will be.  👍🇺🇸

1128777083885371393,2019-05-15 21:40:03,I personally don’t think male legislators should be weighing in on women’s reproductive rights and freedoms.  It should be up to women. I’m happy to let women decide for themselves.
1128776641029836800,2019-05-15 21:38:17,"$1,000 a month for each individual would help society become stronger.   It would help many Americans decide to have and keep children.  One person said to me that the Freedom Dividend is the most pro-life policy being considered in our country."

1128755707036295168,2019-05-15 20:15:06,We spend twice as much on our healthcare as other countries to worse results.  Medicare for All will get a massive burden off of both families and businesses and largely pay for itself through lower rates and expenses. https://t.co/IP3RE5fN6q
1128713213728759809,2019-05-15 17:26:15,The Alabama law banning and criminalizing abortion even in cases of rape or incest is a dramatic step in the wrong direction.  Government should not be making decisions on behalf of women.  I would protect women’s right to choose.

1116747035263340544,2019-04-12 16:56:56,Yup. https://t.co/FTHEFrc4d2
1116744818296852490,2019-04-12 16:48:07,"I understand the passion and frustration with the Electoral College.  For those who wish to change it, again, our challenge is to win the election in 2020.  Focus on that and when we win we will be in better position to have these conversations.  👍🇺🇸"
1116743100427325440,2019-04-12 16:41:17,If I were to advocate for any change it would be to make states award electors proportionally instead of winner-take-all. This would lead candidates to campaign everywhere and not just the ~12 battleground states. I believe Americans would appreciate this change a great deal.

That’s a very unprincipled place to be.  We need to win an election by the rules we have before we call for any changes."
1116741920452239361,2019-04-12 16:36:36,"Second, the incentives would drive candidates to campaign in high-density cities and big media markets.  It would skew both campaigns and policies against lower-density rural areas in a very direct way."
1116741600380686336,2019-04-12 16:35:20,"First, getting rid of the Electoral College would require a Constitutional amendment. This would be a non-starter with many legislators whose states would lose electors.  It’s an impractical conversation to raise."
1116740913781510146,2019-04-12 16:32:36,I think Democrats calling for getting rid of the Electoral College are off-base for a few reasons. Of course I get the beauty and simplicity of saying “whoever gets more votes wins.” It seems like the essence of democracy and has a strong innate appeal.

But it’s not like we are giving voters pop quizzes at the polls to see how much info they have. We have low information voters voting all of the time. There might be a correlation with other factors than age.
1113623225311821826,2019-04-04 02:04:01,To me right now our electorate skews older on every dimension.  And our policies reflect it.  Younger people participate less and are disengaged.  Anything you can do to move the needle there you should explore.

1104729793948540928,2019-03-10 13:04:42,"Putting buying power into our hands will give rise to a whole new set of opportunities. It will lead to unprecedented levels of entrepreneurship, creativity and caregiving.  We can make the economy work for us instead of being inputs into a machine."
1104728692176183297,2019-03-10 13:00:19,The dynamics of the winner-take-all economy are only accelerating.  Reversing them will take policies that seem dramatic but have the potential to actually move us forward. We need to start trusting people and not institutions.
1104727279043788800,2019-03-10 12:54:42,"Studies have shown that even the winners are unhappier in unequal societies.  Higher levels of distrust, suspicion and alienation.  Inequality is bad for everyone.  And inequality is at record highs in the US."
1104726171399393282,2019-03-10 12:50:18,It’s clear that a robust middle class helps people at every level.  Strong consumers mean strong businesses.  Money in consumers’ hands would circulate several times throughout the economy and generate accessible jobs.
1104725198551597056,2019-03-10 12:46:26,Trickle-down economics doesn’t work. We should put more buying power into people’s hands. Part of this is increasing tax rates at the top to be more progressive. The Freedom Dividend and a VAT to harness the gains from new innovations would lead to a Trickle-Up economy.

1104502923600506880,2019-03-09 22:03:12,Tech has gone from being deified to villainized in record time. They have historically been immune from regulation because no one in government understood tech. The next step is to curb and address abuses and excesses. I know enough techies to believe they would be open to this.
1104500123680366593,2019-03-09 21:52:04,Another issue is how we get information. Does fragmenting the social media apps solve the fake news problem or help bring us into a common set of facts? Unclear that it does. We need a nuanced approach to big tech with a different toolkit than we have historically used.
1104498218451247113,2019-03-09 21:44:30,One big issue is acquisitions. The current business plan for startups is to get acquired by one of the behemoths. This is what is truly consolidating power and innovation in certain companies.
1104497521026625536,2019-03-09 21:41:44,Sometimes tech companies should indeed be forced to divest parts of their businesses.  Shouldn’t control both distribution and then sell your own wares at an advantage like Amazon does.
1104496737211895810,2019-03-09 21:38:37,"Agree there are fundamental issues with big tech. But we need to expand our toolset. For example, we should share in the profits from the use of our data. Better than simply regulating. Need a new legal regime that doesn’t rely on consumer prices for anti-trust."

1104491734053068802,2019-03-09 21:18:44,The temptation is to think that breaking up tech companies will restore Main Street businesses. It won’t. We need to think much bigger about how to address the problems of the 21st century economy. Sharing the gains from new innovations is the place to start.

1097997068818354177,2019-02-19 23:11:15,US antitrust laws are hopelessly out of date. They are designed to prohibit price gouging due to monopoly power.

In your Netflix example that $4/ month increase times all of your services might eat up ~$100 of the $1,000"

It is ridiculous that cities and states bid against each other to no net economic benefit for the US. Companies should simply move where it makes most sense for their business.
