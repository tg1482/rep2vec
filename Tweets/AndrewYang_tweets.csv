1287091059617456128,2020-07-25 18:23:16,Of course a Universal Basic Income would dramatically increase both the flexibility of and the resources that go to supporting artists. üëç
1287090014443253765,2020-07-25 18:19:07,Other possibilities are grants or public funding.
1287089604961677312,2020-07-25 18:17:29,Could be advertisers who pre-pay and then you support whom you wish. This is the win-win. Companies pay you to patronize your favorite artists. Builds relationship. Could see it as rebate for purchase too.
1287088915829137409,2020-07-25 18:14:45,Directly from consumers and patrons is the easiest and best. Problem is many people are conditioned to access music at very low costs.
1287084146087604225,2020-07-25 17:55:47,The best approach would be micropayments - not advertising - for people who create and perform music. So if I listen to a song or watch a video I pay a tiny bit and barely notice. Could be funded in different ways.
1287079412433858560,2020-07-25 17:36:59,Streaming royalties seem ridiculously insufficient.

1136701280875757568,2019-06-06 18:27:58,The best balance would be term limits that are quite long - say 18 years - that would be long enough for expertise and coalitions to be built up without letting legislators become totally careerist and self-dealing.
1136700653630214144,2019-06-06 18:25:29,The drawback to term limits is that they would entrench the non-legislative bureaucracy and may make it harder for legislators to organize as everyone keeps showing up new with a learning curve and a need to form relationships and coalitions.

1136694514695802880,2019-06-06 18:01:05,Term limits in DC are a good idea - they would lead legislators to try and get something done and then go home. They would also make room for new leaders. We all know some folks have been in DC for a very long time.

1129187328117878784,2019-05-17 00:50:12,Sometimes people ask me if I knew the campaign would do this well.  I always believed we would.  The most surprising thing to me is just how winnable this race is.
1129167309199880193,2019-05-16 23:30:40,Thanks to you all we are guaranteed a spot on the debate stage by meeting both the donor and the polling thresholds. That‚Äôs for both of the debates in June and July.  Thank you!!  We will make the most of it.  üëçüá∫üá∏ü•ä

1129036918220611586,2019-05-16 14:52:32,I will say that this is about the only thing that might get rich parents to move to poor neighborhoods.
1129034490142220289,2019-05-16 14:42:53,We invented the SAT during World War II to identify smart kids to keep away from the frontlines.  Now every year is wartime.

1129013099506425856,2019-05-16 13:17:53,Most of that money would add to economic activity and growth in our communities and neighborhoods.  It doesn‚Äôt disappear.  Quite the opposite.  It would bolster a trickle-up economy from our families and people up.  It would make our economy much more dynamic and mobile.
1129012432238780416,2019-05-16 13:15:14,"It‚Äôs our money anyway.  We are all citizens and shareholders of the richest society in the history of the world.  We all contribute to our historic growth and success - and in an economy of $20 trillion we can easily afford a dividend of $1,000 a month."

1129008967794024448,2019-05-16 13:01:28,Now we have to debate it in the most important arena of all - the American public.  If enough of us get together we can make it real.  Change can happen faster than most believe possible.
1129008356335771648,2019-05-16 12:59:02,Universal Basic Income is becoming more and more mainstream - it has gone from marginal idea to a proposal debated in major publications and institutions.

1104728692176183297,2019-03-10 13:00:19,The dynamics of the winner-take-all economy are only accelerating.  Reversing them will take policies that seem dramatic but have the potential to actually move us forward. We need to start trusting people and not institutions.

1104502923600506880,2019-03-09 22:03:12,Tech has gone from being deified to villainized in record time. They have historically been immune from regulation because no one in government understood tech. The next step is to curb and address abuses and excesses. I know enough techies to believe they would be open to this.
1104500123680366593,2019-03-09 21:52:04,Another issue is how we get information. Does fragmenting the social media apps solve the fake news problem or help bring us into a common set of facts? Unclear that it does. We need a nuanced approach to big tech with a different toolkit than we have historically used.
1104498218451247113,2019-03-09 21:44:30,One big issue is acquisitions. The current business plan for startups is to get acquired by one of the behemoths. This is what is truly consolidating power and innovation in certain companies.
1104497521026625536,2019-03-09 21:41:44,Sometimes tech companies should indeed be forced to divest parts of their businesses.  Shouldn‚Äôt control both distribution and then sell your own wares at an advantage like Amazon does.
1104496737211895810,2019-03-09 21:38:37,"Agree there are fundamental issues with big tech. But we need to expand our toolset. For example, we should share in the profits from the use of our data. Better than simply regulating. Need a new legal regime that doesn‚Äôt rely on consumer prices for anti-trust."
