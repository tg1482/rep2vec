1052294712688857088,2018-10-16 20:26:24,Reason #19 why you should vote: so immigrants aren’t forced into the shadows. We are a stronger nation because of our diversity.
1052294576164212736,2018-10-16 20:25:52,Reason #18 why you should vote: to elect a Congress that will pass legislation to protect Dreamers. They are Americans in every way except on paper.
